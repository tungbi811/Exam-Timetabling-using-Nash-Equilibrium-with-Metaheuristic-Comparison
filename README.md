# Exam Timetabling using Nash Equilibrium with Metaheuristic Comparison

This project presents a solution to the **Examination Timetabling Problem (ETP)** using a **Nash Equilibrium-based approach**, aiming to efficiently allocate exams to timeslots while minimizing conflicts and constraint violations.

We also conduct a performance comparison against widely-used **metaheuristic techniques**, including:

- Genetic Algorithm (GA)  
- Tabu Search (TS)  
- Simulated Annealing (SA)

## Features

- Nash Equilibrium modeling for stable scheduling
- Comparative analysis with GA, TS, and SA
- Designed for reproducible research and experimentation
- Modular and extensible code structure

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Run the main script to generate timetables and compare methods
